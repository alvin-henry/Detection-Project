Learning Objective: Research in the field of hand gesture recognition focuses on identifying and following human hands in video. The objective is to advance the status of human computer interaction by enabling people to interact with user interfaces with their hands in a powerful and natural manner.

Gesture recognition is a technology that reads and interprets hand gestures as orders using sensors. In the automotive sector, this capacity enables occupants to communicate with the car, often to operate the infotainment system without touching any screens or buttons. The goal is to have 5 gestures trained and tested using python.
