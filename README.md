# Detection-Project
This a hand gesture detection project I worked on a lot of work went into this 
With this project I created the two scripts using PyCharm (I do recommend using this program if possible). The file called "dataCollection.py" is for collecting data aslo 
known as the images for your project, I recommending about 200-300 images pressing "S" will save the images.

Once you have collected the images I do recommend running your pictures through "Teachable Machine" or any training method will work. The code "Test.py" is where you can try out
the code for your self since everything has been trained and tested. Be sure to download everything as a zip folder. I have the "Demostration.mp4" as a demo for you to look at.

# Learning Objective
Research in the field of hand gesture recognition focuses on identifying and following human hands in video. The objective is to advance the status 
of human computer interaction by enabling people to interact with user interfaces with their hands in a powerful and natural manner.
Gesture recognition is a technology that reads and interprets hand gestures as orders using sensors. 
In the automotive sector, this capacity enables occupants to communicate with the car, 
often to operate the infotainment system without touching any screens or buttons. 
The goal is to have 5 gestures trained and tested using python.
